# SIH-DisasterManagement

This project aims to create a comprehensive disaster management system, consisting of an offline app, a website, and a chatbot.

App -> The app is designed to be used as a guidebook in case of a natural disaster, even when internet access is not available. It includes the following features:
- Basic information about different types of disasters
- Do's and donâ€™ts during a disaster
- Rescue helpline contact numbers
- Map of India with addresses of nearby rescue centers (under development)
- Link to the website for further information and assistance in case internet's available.

Website -> The website provides all of the same information as the app, plus additional resources such as:
- More detailed information about different types of disasters
- Multilingual support
- Chatbot for real-time disaster alerts and assistance

Chatbot -> The chatbot provides real-time disaster alerts and assistance to users. It is also used to power the notification alert feature of the app.

Future Plans -> We plan to add the following features to the project in the future:
- Notification alerts for upcoming disasters or warnings
- Forums where people can ask for and offer help during times of adversity

In conclusion This project aims to provide a comprehensive disaster management system that can be used to help people stay safe and informed during natural disasters.
